# Introduction
This repo was made for the Data Science course from AB Syntra, Numpy Project: https://github.com/ypottiez/Numpy-Project
Data and code can be freely used an redistributed with or without changes, no license applied.

# Project information
The purpose of this project is to find a random image and create a series of demanded and chosen manipulations as described in assignment.pdf (see documentation folder)

# Folder structure
Below you will find more information on how the project folder structure was set-up and where to find and store the appropriate files.


## data
Data files can be found in this folder structure in the correct sub-folder as described in the next sub-chapters.

### input
Raw/unchanged files as provided or downloaded. This folder will contain the original image to be manipulated. An example image 'Ouroboros.jpg' can be used.
Changes to dataset will not be saved here to prevent mistakes from happening.

### output
Data that does not need processing anymore but can directly be used. This folder will store the newly manipulated images after running the code.

## documentation
Additional information and guides to help people get started. This folder contains documentation on the assignment

## notebooks
In this folder we save Jupyter notebooks. The notebook 'Numpy assignment Yannick Pottiez.ipynb' contains all the code

 ## Additional files
 In this chapter we are discussing files that are situated in your project root folder and other folders.

### numpyproj.yml
Contains the information about the conda environment.
This file can be used to create a new environment with the same packages as the original environment.
Execute `conda env create -f numpyproj.yml` to create the environment.
Use `conda activate numpyproj` to activate the environment.

### README.md
Markdown file with information about the project, contains the information you are reading now.

 
 # Image Manipulation Toolkit

## Description
The Image Manipulation Toolkit is a Python program that provides a collection of tools for performing various image manipulation tasks. It includes functionalities to resize images, apply filters, adjust colors, and perform other common image processing operations.

## Installation
To use the Image Manipulation Toolkit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/ypottiez/Numpy-Project
2. Create a virtual environment according to numpyproj.yml

## Usage
To run the program, make sure the desired image is stored in the Data/Input folder and execute the 'Numpy assignment Yannick Pottiez.ipynb' notebook from the beginning.


## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the Image Manipulation Toolkit, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes.
